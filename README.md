# Jackal

### What is this?
- Jackal is an application used to track information about your [Rainbow Six Siege](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/home/index.aspx) ranked games.

### Why have you done this?
- Jackal is just a personal project used get more familiar with Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack components (Room, ViewModel, LiveData, MVVM Architecture, etc.). I figured why not build something that I could use myself.
